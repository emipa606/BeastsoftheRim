  <!--<Toraton.description>Due to its sheer size, an adult toraton has no predators and no longer has any need for a shell. Small sections of the ancestoral shell do remain, however, forming an external support for the creature's muscles, which its feeble ribs and vertebrae alone cannot carry.</Toraton.description>-->
